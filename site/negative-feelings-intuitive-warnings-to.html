    <p>Negative feelings—whether it's fear, sadness, anxiety, or frustration—are often dismissed as obstacles to peace. But Neville Goddard offers a transformative perspective: <strong>these feelings are signposts</strong>, guiding us to make powerful shifts in our imagination.</p>
<p>Rather than resisting or ignoring negative emotions, Neville teaches us to see them as intuitive warnings from a <strong>divine source</strong>, pointing us towards a needed change within. These emotions arise when our imagination has veered off course, when we focus on thoughts or images that don't align with our desires. In essence, negative feelings act as <strong>intuitive signals</strong>, reminding us that our inner world needs realignment.</p>
<p>When negativity strikes, pause and ask: <em>What am I imagining right now?</em> The discomfort is an opportunity to reassess your thoughts and beliefs. It’s a chance to take charge of your imagination and redirect it toward the positive outcomes you truly desire. Negative feelings don’t need to be feared; instead, they serve as <strong>guides</strong> to realign your focus and harmonise with your deepest aspirations.</p>
<p>Neville Goddard emphasised that imagination is <strong>the creative force</strong> behind our reality. By consciously shifting the mental images and emotional states we focus on, we can transform our experiences. In this way, negative feelings become powerful reminders that our imagination has the ability to shape and create our external world.</p>
