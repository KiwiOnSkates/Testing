<h1>Why Jesus Distanced Himself from His Earthly Parents</h1>

<p>One of the great misunderstandings of the Bible is that it’s a historical or moral record. But as Neville Goddard taught, it is psychological symbolism — a spiritual autobiography — describing the movement of states within <a href="None">consciousness</a>. And crucially, every major moment in the Bible is rooted in the <strong>symbolic definitions first set out in Genesis</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚑ <strong>Genesis is not just the beginning of the Bible — it is the blueprint.</strong> Every character, miracle, and shift in identity draws its meaning from the inner laws established in those early chapters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most foundational verses is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.”</strong><br />
<em>(Genesis 2:24, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not merely about physical <a href="None">marriage</a>. It symbolises the <strong>inner process of psychological assumption</strong>. To “leave father and mother” is to detach from the assumptions and beliefs you inherited — and to “<a href="None">cleave to your wife</a>” is to consciously join yourself to the new state of being you choose to embody.</p>
<p>Two moments in the Gospels where Jesus appears to turn away from his parents are perfect examples of this <a href="None">law in action</a>. They aren’t about rebellion — they are about realignment.</p>

<h3><strong>“Woman, what have I to do with you?” – The Wedding at Cana</strong></h3>
<p>At the <i>wedding</i> feast in Cana, which highlights <a href="None">marriage</a> and <a href="None">bride and bridegroom</a> symbolism, Mary says to Jesus, “They have no wine.” His response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Woman, this is not your business; my time is still to come.”</strong><br />
<em>(John 2:4, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At face value, this sounds cold or dismissive. But when read through the Law of Assumption, we see something deeper: <strong>Jesus is severing himself from the identity of “<a href="None">Mary’s</a> son.”</strong> He is leaving the familiar, external role — the human self-image — in order to enter into union with the chosen identity: the power and awareness of the “Father within.”</p>
<p>He is fulfilling Genesis 2:24. The old identity must be left before the new one can be assumed. And what happens next? <strong><a href="None">Water</a> becomes wine.</strong> This is the first miracle — the first fruit of the new assumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚑ <strong>Wine</strong> in Scripture symbolises the joy of fulfilled desire. But it cannot flow until the inner <a href="None">marriage</a> has taken place — until you have detached from who you were and joined yourself to who you now choose to be.</p>

<h3><strong>“Did you not know I had to be in my Father’s house?” – The Temple Scene</strong></h3>
<p>When Jesus is <a href="None">twelve</a>, he remains behind in Jerusalem without telling his parents. After searching for him anxiously, they find him in the temple. His words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Why were you looking for me? Was it not clear to you that my right place was in my <a href="None">Father’s house</a>?”</strong><br />
<em>(Luke 2:49, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, <a href="None">Jesus</a> isn’t being disobedient — he’s revealing that his <strong>self-concept has shifted</strong>. He no longer identifies primarily through <a href="None">Mary</a> and Joseph. His <a href="None">consciousness</a> is now “about the Father’s business” — meaning <strong>he has moved into the inner awareness of being the creative power itself</strong>.</p>
<p>In Neville’s terms: <em>God is your own wonderful human imagination.</em> And when Jesus says he is in the Father’s house, he is saying: <strong>I dwell now in the consciousness of I AM — not as a child of history, but as the origin of experience.</strong></p>
<p>He has left the assumptions of his upbringing and cleaved to a new reality — his inner temple of awareness.</p>

<h3><strong>Genesis 2:24: The Universal Pattern</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“For this cause will a man go away from his father and his mother and be joined to his wife; and they will be one flesh.”</strong><br />
<em>(Genesis 2:24, BBE)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not merely about relationships — it is the <strong>fundamental pattern of assumption</strong>. Every time you move from one self-concept to another, this inner marriage must occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>“Father and mother”</strong> symbolise the assumptions you were born into — cultural, familial, emotional, religious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“Wife”</strong> is the chosen state — the inner vision you decide to embody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>“One flesh”</strong> is the outpictured world that results from sustained assumption.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>⚑ <strong>This is the law of assumption:</strong> you must detach from what you were and fully accept that you are now what you have chosen to be — and the outer world will mirror that union.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why Jesus — as the <a href="None">pattern</a> man — repeatedly shows us how to forsake the former self and cleave to the new. His so-called “rebukes” are not rejections of family, but rejections of <strong>old definitions of self</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Shift is Always Internal</strong></h3>
<p>Everything in Scripture — every parable, miracle, and movement — rests on the symbolic foundations laid in Genesis. Genesis 2:24 is not an isolated line about human marriage; it is the hidden map for transformation through the Law of Assumption.</p>
<p>Jesus did not “rebel” against his parents — he shifted identity. He moved from an assumed past to a chosen state, from outer roles to inner awareness. And so must we.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to manifest something new, you cannot drag the old identity into it. You must leave it. And then, cleave to the new with all your heart, soul, and imagination — until you and it are one flesh.</p></blockquote>
