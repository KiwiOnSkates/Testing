    <p>In Ezekiel 9, the prophet sees a striking vision: a man clothed in linen, equipped with a writing kit, is commanded by God to go through Jerusalem and&nbsp;<strong>place a mark on the foreheads</strong>&nbsp;of those who “sigh and cry” over the abominations committed within the city. Those without the mark are handed over to destruction.</p><p>When interpreted through the teachings of&nbsp;<strong>Neville Goddard</strong>, this passage sheds its historical weight and becomes a deeply psychological drama—a reflection of the&nbsp;<strong>awakening of the individual soul</strong>&nbsp;from material consciousness to divine imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Jerusalem as the Mind</strong></h3><p>For Neville,&nbsp;<strong>Jerusalem symbolises the mind or consciousness</strong>—not a city of stone, but the inner world of man. The abominations happening within are symbolic of&nbsp;<strong>corrupt states of thought</strong>: fear, lack, dependency on the outer world, and forgetfulness of the creative power within.</p><p>Those who “sigh and cry” are not external mourners, but inner aspects of the self that&nbsp;<strong>long for spiritual alignment</strong>, that begin to sense something is wrong with the way reality is being created.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Scribe in Linen: The Law of Assumption</strong></h3><p>The man clothed in linen, with the inkhorn at his side, is not a mere angelic being, but the&nbsp;<strong>law of assumption</strong>&nbsp;itself. He symbolises the moment in the psyche when one begins to live deliberately—where imagination is no longer suppressed, but remembered.</p><p>To be marked on the&nbsp;<strong>forehead</strong>&nbsp;is to have your&nbsp;<strong>thinking changed</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>forehead</strong>, in symbolic language, is always associated with&nbsp;<strong>thought</strong>. The mark is not physical—it is a transformation of consciousness. It represents the beginning of a new awareness: a mind shifting from reaction to creation.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Hebrew Word for Sin: “To Miss the Mark”</strong></h3><p>The symbolism deepens when we consider that in Hebrew, the word for&nbsp;<strong>sin</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>"chata’" (חָטָא)</strong>—which literally means&nbsp;<strong>“to miss the mark.”</strong></p><p>This re-frames the idea of sin not as moral failure, but as&nbsp;<strong>a failure to recognise and use the imagination rightly</strong>. To sin is to forget the power of the inner world—to identify instead with outer circumstances, with Cain, and not with Abel.</p><p>In this light, the&nbsp;<strong>mark on the forehead</strong>&nbsp;given in Ezekiel 9 is the&nbsp;<strong>opposite of sin</strong>. It is a&nbsp;<strong>correction of vision</strong>—an inner alignment that sets the individual back on course toward imagination, intention, and divine awareness.&nbsp;</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Death of the Unmarked: Shedding False States</strong></h3><p>Those who are not marked are destroyed—not as an act of vengeance, but symbolically, as a&nbsp;<strong>purging of false states of consciousness</strong>. These are the dead aspects of the mind—the mechanical, ego-driven patterns that no longer serve the evolving soul.</p><p>As Neville would say,&nbsp;<strong>only the states die</strong>—not the individual. The destruction in Ezekiel 9 is the&nbsp;<strong>burning away of unawakened thought</strong>. It is the beginning of the resurrection of imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>The Mark and Cain: A Conscious Parallel</strong></h3><p>This symbolism of the mark echoes the story of&nbsp;<strong>Cain and Abel</strong>. After Cain kills Abel (a symbolic death of the imagination), he is&nbsp;<strong>marked</strong>&nbsp;by the Lord—not as punishment, but as a&nbsp;<strong>sign of his consciousness</strong>, now fallen and identified with the outer world.</p><p>Both Cain and the unmarked in Ezekiel represent&nbsp;<strong>states of man</strong>&nbsp;who are unaware of the inner creative power. But the&nbsp;<strong>mark on the forehead</strong>&nbsp;in Ezekiel is a&nbsp;<strong>sign of awakening</strong>—a sign that the inner man is beginning to turn inward, to “hit the mark” once again, through conscious use of imagination.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Conclusion: The Inner Mark of Awakening</strong></h3><p>The mark in Ezekiel 9 is not about outward religion or divine wrath. It is a&nbsp;<strong>spiritual symbol</strong>&nbsp;of a mind beginning to&nbsp;<strong>remember itself</strong>—a consciousness shifting from separation to unity, from sin (missing the mark) to vision (hitting it).</p><p>To be marked is to begin the journey back to&nbsp;<strong>Christ consciousness</strong>, to the inner alignment Neville called “living in the end”—dwelling in the assumption of the wish fulfilled.</p><p>This mark is given when you “sigh and cry”—when the soul recognises its own fall, not in guilt, but in&nbsp;<strong>yearning to return</strong>&nbsp;to the truth:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“I AM the beginning and the end.”</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><p><br /></p>
