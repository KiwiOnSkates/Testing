    <p>If you come from a traditional Christian background, you may have been taught—like many of us were—that exploring different interpretations of the Bible is something to avoid. Especially anything that veers into symbolism or psychology. It can feel like betrayal.</p>
<p>But I want to gently say: it’s okay to look again.</p>
<p>You’re not turning your back on your faith by studying the Bible’s symbolic meaning. In fact, when you begin to see the inner, psychological message running through the stories—how each figure and moment speaks to your own inner life—you may find yourself closer to the heart of Scripture than ever before.</p>
<p>I fully encourage you to explore this way of seeing. The symbolism isn’t arbitrary or abstract—it’s precise, powerful, and personal. And once you begin to understand it, I truly believe you’ll recognise it as the deeper truth the Bible has been telling all along.</p>
